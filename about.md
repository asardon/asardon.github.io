  Hi, my name is Aetienne! I'm currently studying finance and computer science at Goethe University, Frankfurt. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in business administration and engineering from the Technical University of Darmstadt. Parallel to my studies, I'm also working as a Python developer at Prime Capital, a Frankfurt based hedge fund. I love learning new things and I'm particularly passionate about machine learning, quantitative finance and entrepreneurship.

Thanks for reading!
